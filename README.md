#Project to meet the following requirements:

The project requirements:

The user should be able to add the contact information where:
name - is required
email - is required
phone - optional
User should be able to favorite the contact.
User should be able to see the list of all contacts and list of favorite contacts
In the contacts list, the user should be able to toggle "favorite" on and off. If the contact was unfavorited, it should disappear from the list of favorite contacts.
You should be able to modify existing contact.
The data should be persistent so you might want to use the localStore for simplicity.

Tech stack:

You can use the language of your choice but we would prefer the TypeScript.
You can use any framework of your choice.
Please, showcase us some CSS knowledge. You can use any preprocessors like SCSS, LESS or others.

Things which we will care about are:

The source code quality. It should be well formatted and easy to review
The UI. The application should look nice (subjectively) and easy to use. Ideally mobile friendly.
The form fields validation
Commits quality - Commits titles should follow the angular conventions. Each logical task should be in a separate commit.
Configured linter would be welcome but not required
Some unit and/or e2e tests are welcome but not required
